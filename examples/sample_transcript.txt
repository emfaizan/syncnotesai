Team Standup Meeting - January 22, 2025

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's start with updates from last sprint.

John: I completed the authentication module. It's ready for review. However, we need to decide on the session timeout duration.

Mike: I suggest we go with 30 minutes for security reasons.

Sarah: Agreed. Let's set the session timeout to 30 minutes.

Lisa: I'm working on the dashboard redesign. I'll have the mockups ready by tomorrow for the team to review.

John: That's great. I can help with the frontend implementation once the designs are approved.

Sarah: Perfect. Lisa, please share the mockups in Slack by end of day tomorrow.

Mike: I need to address the API rate limiting issue. I'll investigate the root cause and prepare a fix by next Friday.

Sarah: Thanks Mike. Also, we've decided to move forward with the PostgreSQL database migration instead of MongoDB.

Lisa: That makes sense given our relational data structure.

John: I'll update the database schema documentation by next week to reflect this decision.

Sarah: Excellent. One more thing - we need someone to prepare the onboarding slides for the new developers joining next month.

Mike: I can do that. When do you need them?

Sarah: By this Friday would be ideal.

Mike: Consider it done.

Sarah: Great! Any blockers or concerns?

Lisa: No blockers on my end.

John: All good here.

Mike: Same here.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's wrap up. Thanks everyone!
